# Customer-segmentation-project
This project deals with customer segmentation for the businesses to make strategic decisions with their procucts. This project consist of a mall visitors data and we are using kmeans algorithm to classify the customers with the given data. This machine  learning model comes under UnSupervised learning model. 
We have took a mall customers data from the kaggle and started processing it.
After importing the data to the data model we find the attributees related to our final aim of the project.
We found age, spending scores and annual income are the inputs for understanding the customers flow to the business.
We cleaned the data and fetched out the data we wanted and started ploting the graphs to the requirements and understood the data of the customers who visit mall for purchases of different products.
We started training the machine model to the with train_test module and fited it to the variable.
We used kmeans algorithm to find total number of clusters can be formed with the given data. By the end we found we can form 4 clusters can be formed with the given data and started ploting a 3D graph to the given fit model.
By the end we have clusterd 4 groups of customers based on thier annual income, spending scores and age.
